## üöÄ Welcome to My LeetCode Journey! üåå

Hello fellow coders! üëã Welcome to my quirky and fun repository where I store all my solutions to LeetCode problems. Whether you're here to explore, learn, or just for a good laugh, you're in the right place! Let's dive into the magical world of coding challenges together. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

### Setting Up the LeetCode Extension in VSCode

Before we start conquering challenges, let's set up our environment. I use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with the LeetCode extension. It's like having a coding dojo right in your editor! ü•ãüíª Here‚Äôs how you can set it up too:

1. **Install Visual Studio Code**: If you haven‚Äôt already, [download VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Open VSCode Extensions**: Click on the extensions icon in the sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`.

3. **Search for "LeetCode"**: Find the LeetCode extension by [shengchen](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shengchen.vscode-leetcode). It‚Äôs the one with a cool little ninja icon! ü•∑

4. **Install the Extension**: Just click 'Install'. Easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy!

5. **Login to LeetCode**: Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), type `LeetCode Sign In`, and enter your credentials. If you're a ninja in disguise, make sure to use your stealthy login skills. üê±‚Äçüë§

### Initializing Your Own LeetCode Repo in VSCode

Now, let's get your personal LeetCode repository started! Here's a step-by-step guide to make it as smooth as butter on a hot pancake. ü•û

1. **Create a New Repo**: If you haven't yet, create a new repository on GitHub. Give it a name that sparks joy!

2. **Clone the Repo in VSCode**: In VSCode, press `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type `Git: Clone`, and paste your repo's URL. Choose a comfortable spot on your computer for it to live.

3. **Open Your Repo**: After cloning, VSCode will ask if you want to open the repository. Go for it!

4. **Add a Remote**: If you've started locally, add a remote pointing to your GitHub repo. Open the terminal in VSCode (`Ctrl+```) and type:
   ```
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
   ```

5. **Start Adding Solutions**: Now, whenever you solve a problem on LeetCode, add the solution to this repository. You can create a directory for each problem or organize it however you like ‚Äì unleash your inner organizer! üìÅ‚ú®

6. **Commit and Push**: After adding your solutions, don't forget to commit and push your changes. Let the world see your awesome work!
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add solution for problem XYZ"
   git push origin master
   ```

7. **Rinse and Repeat**: Keep solving, keep adding. Let this repo be a testament to your journey and growth!

### Why Keep a LeetCode Repo?

- üìö **Learning**: Review your progress and solutions over time.
- ü§ù **Sharing**: Help others learn from your solutions and approach.
- üëÄ **Visibility**: Show your problem-solving skills to the world (or maybe future employers!).

### Let's Connect!

If you find this repo helpful or if you have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always open to collaboration and learning from the community.

Happy coding, and may the code be ever in your favor! üåü

‚≠ê Star this repo if you find it quirky, fun, or helpful. Happy LeetCode-ing! üòÑüéâ

### Setting Up Debugging in TypeScript/JavaScript

#### Visual Studio Code

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your system. This provides the runtime for running JavaScript outside a browser and is essential for debugging TypeScript/JavaScript projects.

2. **Configure `launch.json`**:
   - In VSCode, navigate to the Debug view (`Ctrl+Shift+D` or `Cmd+Shift+D` on macOS).
   - Click on the "create a launch.json file" link and select the Node.js environment. This file tells VSCode how to launch and debug your application.

3. **Install TypeScript and ts-node** (for TypeScript projects):
   - Run `npm install typescript ts-node --save-dev` in your project directory. `ts-node` allows you to run TypeScript files directly in Node.js.

4. **Debugging**:
   - Set breakpoints in your code by clicking the left margin next to the line numbers in the editor.
   - Press `F5` to start debugging. Use the debug controls to step through your code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions.

#### Browser

For client-side JavaScript debugging:
- Use Developer Tools in your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools).
- Open the DevTools (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Opt+I` on macOS), go to the Sources tab, and set breakpoints directly in your JavaScript code.
- Refresh your page to hit the breakpoints and step through your code.

### Setting Up Debugging in Python

#### Visual Studio Code

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system and accessible from your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Configure `launch.json`**:
   - In VSCode, open your Python project.
   - Go to the Debug view and click on "create a launch.json file", then select the Python environment.
   - Adjust the `program` path to point to the script you want to debug.

3. **Debugging**:
   - Set breakpoints by clicking next to the line numbers.
   - Press `F5` to start debugging. Use the debug controls to step over, into, or out of your code blocks.

#### Command Line

For a simpler setup or when working outside of VSCode, you can use `pdb`, the Python debugger:

```python
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

- Insert the above line into your Python script at the point where you want to start debugging.
- Run your script. Execution will pause at `pdb.set_trace()`, and you can use `pdb` commands (`n` for next, `c` for continue, etc.) to debug.
